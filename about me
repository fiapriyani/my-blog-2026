Welcome to Matchadreamy.com!

I’m Fitri Apriyani, a blogger from Jakarta, Indonesia.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Trisakti School of Management and actively write on my blog and other writing platforms such as Kompasiana and Medium.

I have previously worked as a Content Writer for an online media outlet and a finance-themed website.

Writing Background
I used to have a blog called fiapriyani.blogspot.com, which started as a college assignment and later became my personal diary as a student.

After resigning as a Finance Staff, I decided to take blogging seriously by creating Matchadreamy.com, where I can pour my ideas into writing.

Professionally, this blog also serves as my digital portfolio.

Why Matchadreamy.com?
I’m a matcha lover! 🍵

When people think of matcha, they imagine a warm green drink that’s comforting, with a bittersweet yet pleasant taste.

That’s precisely the feeling I want to bring into my writing — so readers can enjoy my posts like a comforting cup of warm matcha.

Writing Themes
In general, I enjoy writing about various topics.

More specifically, here are some themes I often cover on this blog:

SEO
Blogging
Travel
Culinary
Digital Marketing
Education
Sustainability — lately, I’ve been particularly interested in exploring sustainability topics, especially those related to lifestyle and digital impact.
